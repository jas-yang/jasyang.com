Hey! This is a simple static site generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) that serves as my personal landing page, blog, and portfolio. 

I'm an MIT computer science graduate 🎓, originally hailing from Los Angeles, CA ☀️. I'm passionate about creating fun and interesting apps and services- especially those that leverge the power of data. Check out my [projects](/projects) for my details!

I also love watching sunsets 🌅, driving cool cars 🚗, and watching sunsets while driving cool cars 😎. If I'm not developing, you'll find me in the gym trying to perfect my weightlifting technique 🏋🏻, driving around LA with friends 🌊, or trying to get better at [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).
