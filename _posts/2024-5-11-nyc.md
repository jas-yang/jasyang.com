title: A post about being post-grad 
---

It's 8:30pm on a Saturday night here in New York City. I realized I still pay for this domain and it's been literally *years* since I've looked at my own website which is kind of embarassing. When I first made this website, I was fresh out of undergrad riding the high of using my skills to build something novel for the first time, thinking that I would start my own blog that everyone will read *lol* and conquer the world. 

The plan back then was to start my MEng program in the Fall after interning somewhere for a semester and maybe a summer. The term "post-grad" didn't really mean anything - I assumed the natural path forward would come to me like it always had starting since elementary school all the way to walking down Killian to grab my diploma. 

I now realize that the world after academia is not a natural path forward, and I would have to make a series of decisions for myself that would have long lasting effects that I can never predict. Furthermore, If I sat complacent and avoided making hard decisions, no one would make them for me. There is no *Dean's List* after college. There is no *academic probation* in the real world to scare me into staying diciplined. I walk forward as fast as I want to, and if I want to sit on the ground and twiddle my thumbs I can do so as I please. 

One of those decisions I made for myself was to move to New York from Boston. The best thing about post-grad is having the financial and logistical freedom to make these decisions for yourself. Moving to New York was the first major call that I made for my own life with no one's help but my own. At age 23 I decided that I want to live in this city, and I can make it happen for myself if I really wanted to. Having the autonomy to move to a city of my choosing and afford it is a huge blessing that is not lost on me, and I am very grateful that I am lucky to have made enough right choices to this point in my life to do this thing for myself.

However, with this freedom and autonomy comes a whole additional basket of anxieties and challenges to manage. Am I specializing in the right domain? Am I learning enough and growing at my current job? How do I balance work and my personal life? Am I socializing enough? Is it wrong to feel *unsatisfied* with my career? Is it wrong to feel *satisfied* with my career? Am I saving enough money? Am I neglecting my family by moving across the country because that's what I *wanted*? 

I don't really have the answers to any of these questions, and I doubt many people do. But I think that's okay. I read the post below this one before writing this, and it gave me a moment to reflect and realize how differently I think now - even after only a year or so. I'm sure I'll have answered some of these questions come another year, and I'll probably have a completely new set of questions that I'll complain about while writing a new post. 

Post grad life is confusing and uncertain but so is everything else. Best to just keep walking forward I guess. Better than twiddling your thumbs on the ground.
