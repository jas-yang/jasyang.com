I"ü<p>Hey! This is my first post on this website, I hope there will be many to come.
I just wrapped up my final semester of undergrad here at MIT, and one of my last classes was <a href="https://61040-fa22.github.io/">6.1040: Software Studio</a>, a class designed to be a design oriented class where the final project was creating your own web-app!</p>

<p>Although this is just a static website, I was inspired to create a domain where I can showcase my work, as well as voice my opinions on certain topics in a forum that isnâ€™t just my friendsâ€™ group chat.</p>

<p>Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).</p>

<p><img src="/images/config.png" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
