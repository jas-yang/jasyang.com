I"à<p>Hey! This is my first post on this website, I hope there will be many to come.
I just wrapped up my final semester of undergrad here at MIT, and one of my last classes was <a href="https://61040-fa22.github.io/">6.1040: Software Studio</a>, a class designed to be a design oriented class where the final project was creating your own web-app! You can check it out <a href="https://ourspace.jasyang.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this is just a static website, I was inspired to create a domain where I can showcase my work, as well as voice my opinions on certain topics in a forum that isnâ€™t just my friendsâ€™ group chat. I donâ€™t intend this blog to be strictly professional - for now, I want to have fun and have an area where people can get to know me ðŸ˜„.</p>

<p>For my first blogpost, I want to talk about how I feel about graduating. Itâ€™s been a long time coming, and today marked the final day of assignments and classes of my officially last semester as a CS undergrad at MIT. MIT was hard, and it forced me to adapt and learn quickly- not only about my studies but about myself and how the olâ€™ pink matter operates up there ðŸ§ . But I donâ€™t really feel any sort of remarkable achievement or deeper meaning today. Going to college and graduating was always going to be part of the playbook, coming from a household of immigrant parents and being the first kid in the family to attend school- a great school no less.</p>
