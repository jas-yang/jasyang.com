I"¼<p>Hey! This is my first post on this website, I hope there will be many to come.</p>

<p>I just wrapped up my final semester of undergrad here at MIT, and one of my last classes was <a href="https://61040-fa22.github.io/">6.1040: Software Studio</a>, a class designed to be a design oriented class where the final project was creating your own web-app! You can check it out <a href="https://ourspace.jasyang.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this is just a static website, I was inspired to create a domain where I can showcase my work, as well as voice my opinions on certain topics in a forum that isnâ€™t just my friendsâ€™ group chat.</p>

<p>The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
