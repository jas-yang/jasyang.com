I"£<p>Hey! This is my first post on this website, I hope there will be many to come.
I just wrapped up my final semester of undergrad here at MIT, and one of my last classes was <a href="https://61040-fa22.github.io/">6.1040: Software Studio</a>, a class designed to be a design oriented class where the final project was creating your own web-app!
