Hey — I'm a CS grad from MIT 🎓, originally from LA and now based in NYC 🏙️. I spend my time building systems that drive meaningful products, *especially* ones where thoughtful engineering makes a real difference.

At [Regard](https://regard.com), I’ve led backend and AI infrastructure projects that help doctors work smarter and faster. From streamlining how diagnoses are created to designing a multi-agent AI note editor, I enjoy solving messy problems and making tools that scale.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me:
* Lifting at the gym 🏋🏻
* Chasing sunsets whenever I can 🌅
* Experimenting with new techniques in the kitchen 🍳
* Or writing little scripts to fix annoyances—then sharing them with the team 😄

This site is a simple space to share more about me and occasionally write down thoughts I want to revisit. If you’re curious about my technical background, check out my [resume](/resume).
